# VerdeX
VerdeX is a student-driven sustainability platform that converts everyday campus issues into a live Green Campus Score. Students report problems like water leaks, electricity waste, cleanliness, hygiene, and noise. Unresolved issues lower the score, resolved ones raise it—making sustainability visible, measurable, and actionable.
